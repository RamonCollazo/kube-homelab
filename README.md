# üè° Kubernetes Homelab

This repository is the **single source of truth** for my personal Kubernetes homelab cluster, managed entirely through **GitOps**. Every piece of infrastructure, every operator, and every application is defined as code right here.

## Introduction

As a Kubernetes enthusiast, my homelab is where I:

  * **Test and validate** modern, production-grade tools.
  * **Take ownership** of the entire application lifecycle, from deployment to backup and security.
  * **Enforce best practices** like infrastructure immutability, GitOps principles, and automated dependency management.

If you are on your own homelab journey, I hope this repository serves as a valuable resource and source of inspiration\!

## Cluster Architecture

My cluster uses modern, cloud-native principles to ensure it is secure, reliable, and easily reproducible.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Technologies & Principles

| Category | Tool / Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operating System** | **Talos Linux** | Immutable, minimal, and secure OS designed specifically for Kubernetes. |
| **GitOps Engine** | **FluxCD** | Continuously reconciles the cluster state with this repository. |
| **CNI & Ingress** | **Cilium** | eBPF-based networking, and acting as the **Ingress Controller**. |
| **Storage (CSI)** | **Rook-Ceph** | Provides highly available, distributed storage across my nodes. |
| **Secrets Management** | **SOPS** | Encrypts sensitive data directly in Git using an Age key. |

### üìÇ Repository Structure (Monorepo)

The cluster state is defined using a **monorepo** structure, which allows for a clear separation between core cluster components and end-user applications.

### üîí Secrets Management

All sensitive configuration data is committed to this public repository in an **encrypted** state using **SOPS (Secrets OPerationS)** with **Age Encryption**. The Flux controllers securely decrypt these files at runtime using a private key stored only within the cluster.

## üíª Hardware

My homelab operates on a hybrid architecture, balancing a low-power control plane with a dedicated worker node for stateful and resource-intensive workloads.

| Device | CPU & Memory | Storage | OS | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raspberry Pi 4** | 8GB RAM | 1 x 256GB SD | **Talos Linux** | **Control Plane** |
| **Lenovo ThinkStation Mini P330** | i7-8700T / 64GB RAM | 1 x 128GB NVME, 1 x 1TB NVME | **Talos Linux** | **Worker Node** |

## üöÄ Installed Apps & Infrastructure

### Apps

These are the end-user applications currently deployed and managed by Flux.

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **linkding** | A minimal, self-hosted bookmark manager. |

### Infrastructure

These are the essential cluster-wide services and operators that enable the entire environment.

| Name | Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cilium** | Networking/Ingress | Provides CNI capabilities and acts as the **Ingress Controller** for all incoming traffic via eBPF. |
| **Rook-Ceph** | Storage | Manages the highly available, distributed storage layer using the disks on the worker node. |
| **kube-prometheus-stack**| Monitoring/Observability | The full suite of Prometheus for metrics and alerting, and Grafana for visualization. |
